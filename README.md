Methodology and Findings:
after cleaning and analyzing the data, we approached it from the point of view of helping the real estate agency focus and use their efforts 
and resources in the most suitable market
to do this we first looked into which price range market is most suitable based on demand, then we looked into which locations fulfill that price range.
then finally we compared different variable predictors with our price to see what influences it most and then suggest that they focus and look at those
variables whilst looking at houses in the market range and location we suggest
