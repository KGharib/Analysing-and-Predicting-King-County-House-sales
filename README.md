# Predicting-Sentiment-on-Amazon-Reviews

### Executive Summary
The Data used is from: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
<br><br>
We will be using the King County Dataset in this project, we will perform EDA, and then answer a few questions based on the data, finally we will predict the House Sale price based on a number of features using Supervised Learning Methods
<br><br>

### Pre-Processing Steps
- replaced Null values from waterfront and yr_renovated with the median, the reason being is i wanted to preserve the Median value for that column for future statistical anaylsis.
- removed Null/Missing values from view columns as it was only 63 missing points, and our dataset was fairly large enough that removing them would not have a negative effect
- changed Date column into a dtype format from integer to be able to do date time anaylsis
- removed "?" values in sqft_basement
